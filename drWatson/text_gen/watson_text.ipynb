Why should a warrant be required to search\n","the house? Obviously, then, that the head of State be at the\n","territory. And yet would there be a warrant at all?”\n","\n","“Nay; the family would be in London immediately. It is a small country\n","and a great danger, so it is taken as being left behind.”\n","\n","“Nothing new in the world, Holmes,” said the secretary. “Nothing\n","more to add. But still, why should a warrant be required to search\n","the house?”\n","\n","“Well, sir, there is the problem which we have to solve. The plans\n","which the Cadogan West agents have brought with them to London have\n","been dispatched by some of the Chinese. Presumably they have intercepted\n","these plans and plans have been dispatched by someone other than\n","the agent?”\n","\n","“It would appear to me,” said Holmes, staring with great curiosity at the\n","figures upon the children’s faces, “and the enormous estate which the\n","agent of fortune would bring with him if he or she wished to avoid\n","the detection of any foreign power, than it would appear to us to be\n","either a most unlikely and undesirable affair, and that his\n","intimate family might be living there with them, totally harmless,\n","with their own agents?”\n","\n","“Exactly; we can understand, Mr. Holmes, so far as this problem goes.• ‘Nothing more to add,’\n","Sterndale, we have failed miserably in our task. Now we may\n","set the missing persons adrift. Let us think of something more suitable.\n","Lestrade, should we be detected, reported to Woolwich\n","agent, Arthur Cadogan West.”\n","\n","They sat together in the gloomy and often dark house in which the\n","Fortune Round table was framed. The agent of fortune was a\n","bachelor, active at Gloucester by the name of George, and a frequent visitor to\n","Woolwich. He had made inquiries into my household, and as\n","I said in my telegram to him afterwards that he had made no\n","effort to find me, he had considerable news to make over the\n","villain.\n","\n","“We fear, Mr. Holmes, that it may be the charms of your august\n","house which are the more likely culprits. There is a good deal that is\n","irrelevant in the matter, and it may well be that some part of it\n","has already been told to me. You can imagine that at the present moment\n","nothing\n","of mine is in your office.”\n","\n","“But this case leads straight to the conclusion that it belongs to the\n","other end.”\n","\n","“Of course not. There is certainly a fair amount of material out of which\n","I have come. There is also one more point which may interest you.\n","In that there is some writing upon a lamp-dust-pan, but no\n","writing upon a door-step. I have no desire to write in the\n","present state, but I may at once put the matter into my notebook\n","and explain what has become of the positive success of my\n","advice. These days, therefore, I take the lead in the matter. Thank you,\n","Watson, you have added a great deal to the value of this valuable\n","object. Now, in the light of the foregoing, I should be\n","humorous in my congratulations, but I beg you to be humble in your\n","prodigious questions. Let me offer you an example.
